# Rice-REU-2022
- Participated in an NSF-sponsored REU as a part of the Reconfigurable Ecosystem for Next generation End-to-end Wireless project.
- Used Git and Github for software development and version control.
- Worked with an open-source massive MIMO platform for research in wireless technology.
- Observed the Channel State Information statistics obtained from streams of data sent between user equipment clients and base station antennas.
- Helped develop a tool in Python that visually and statistically fits different probability distributions to channel data collected from Iris Software Defined Radios.
- Used a Linux-based host machine to collect data from Iris SDRs.
- Utilized RenewLabs C++-based framework Sounder to collect, record, and read data obtained from base station antennas.
- Used the Python tool to fit the Rayleigh Fading and Rician Fading distributions to a histogram of the CSI.
